2. In what ways do AI applications transform different industries, and what challenges do they present?
3. What ethical considerations should guide the development and deployment of AI technologies?

## Lesson Procedure

### Total Duration: 90 minutes

#### Opening Hook (10 minutes)

- Begin with a provocative question: *“Imagine a world where AI makes all decisions for us. What benefits and risks do you foresee?”*
- Facilitate a brief think-pair-share where students discuss their ideas with a partner.
- Share a short video clip or infographic highlighting surprising AI applications in daily life.

#### Direct Instruction (25 minutes)

- Present a clear definition of AI literacy and why it matters today.
- Introduce key AI concepts and terminology using visuals and real-world examples.
- Highlight diverse AI use cases across industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.
- Discuss potential positive and negative impacts of AI in these contexts, emphasizing ethical considerations.

#### Guided Practice (20 minutes)

- Divide students into small groups; assign each group an industry sector (e.g., healthcare, finance, education).
- Provide a brief case study or scenario describing an AI application in that sector.
- Groups analyze the use case focusing on: purpose, benefits, risks, and ethical questions.
- Groups prepare a 3-minute presentation summarizing their analysis.

#### Independent Practice (20 minutes)

- Students individually write a reflective response addressing: 
  - Which AI use case they found most impactful and why.
  - What ethical challenges they think are most critical in AI deployment.
- Encourage citing examples from group presentations or direct instruction.

#### Closing (15 minutes)

- Groups present their case study analyses to the class.
- Facilitate a whole-class discussion reflecting on common themes and divergent viewpoints.
- Summarize key takeaways about AI literacy and its importance in understanding technology’s role in society.

## Extension Activities & Assessments

### Differentiated Activities

- **Below Grade Level (Support):**
  - Provide a simplified glossary of AI terms with visual aids.
  - Assign a guided worksheet with sentence starters for the reflective writing.
- **At Grade Level (Core):**
  - Engage in group case study analysis and presentations as outlined.
  - Write a structured reflection on AI use cases and ethics.
- **Above Grade Level (Extension):**
  - Research and present an emerging AI technology not covered in class.
  - Develop a short ethical guideline proposal for AI use in a chosen industry.

### Assessments

- **Formative:**
  - Observation of group discussions and presentations for understanding of AI concepts and implications.
  - Review of reflective writing for depth of analysis and connection to lesson objectives.
- **Summative:**
  - A short essay or project analyzing an AI use case, including ethical considerations and societal impact.
