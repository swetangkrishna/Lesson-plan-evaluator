Lesson Seed: AI Literacy
1. Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

Recall key concepts and terminology related to artificial intelligence (AI).
Apply AI tools to solve a simple problem or case study scenario.
Analyze the ethical implications of AI technologies and their impact on society.
2. Prior Knowledge & Cue Sets
To engage with the topic of AI literacy, students should have a foundational understanding of:

Basic computer science principles.
The concept of algorithms and data.
Cueing Strategies:
Discussion Prompt: Ask students to share their prior experiences with AI (e.g., virtual assistants, recommendation systems).
Visual Aid: Show a graphic representation of AI applications in everyday life (e.g., healthcare, finance, entertainment).
Real-World Connection: Present a current news article highlighting a recent development in AI technology.
3. Direct Instruction Strategies
Explicit Instruction: Conduct a mini-lecture introducing key terms (e.g., machine learning, neural networks) with guided notes for students.
Demonstration: Showcase a popular AI tool (e.g., a chatbot) and explain its functionalities in real-time.
Inquiry-Based Exploration: Pose an open-ended question about the future of AI and have students brainstorm possible answers in small groups.
4. Student Practice & Application
Independent Activities:
Guided Practice Worksheet: Have students complete a worksheet identifying AI applications in various industries.
Concept Mapping: Students create a concept map linking AI terms and their definitions.
Hands-on Experiment: Use a simple AI tool (e.g., Google AutoML) to create a basic predictive model.
Collaborative Activities:
Think-Pair-Share: Students discuss their views on AI's role in society with a partner, then share insights with the class.
Case Study Analysis: In small groups, analyze a case study on AI ethics and present findings to the class.
Role-Playing: Simulate a debate on the pros and cons of AI in daily life, assigning roles to each group member.
5. Formative Assessments
Exit Tickets: Students write one key takeaway from the lesson related to AI literacy.
Quick Concept Quiz: Administer a short quiz covering key terms and concepts discussed in class.
Interactive Class Poll: Use an online tool (e.g., Kahoot) to assess understanding of AI applications and ethics.
6. Deep Thinking & Reflection
How do current AI technologies reflect or challenge our ethical standards?
In what ways can AI enhance human capabilities, and where might it limit them?
What are the potential long-term societal impacts of widespread AI adoption?
Discuss the balance between innovation and ethical responsibility in the development of AI technologies.
How would you approach a situation where an AI tool produces biased or unfair outcomes?
This lesson seed is structured to engage post-secondary students actively in understanding AI literacy within a 52-minute class period, promoting higher-order thinking and collaborative learning
