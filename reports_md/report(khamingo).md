# Unified Lesson Plan Report (ULPR)

Total: **70 / 100**


## A. Outcomes & Alignment — 19 pts

**A1 SMARTIE Outcomes & Success Criteria** — band 3 → 6.0/8

*Evidence:* The learning objective is clear and specific, with measurable verbs. The student-facing objective is also well-stated. However, the outcomes could be more explicitly linked to the aims.


**A2 Alignment: TLAs ↔ Outcomes ↔ Assessment** — band 4 → 9.0/9

*Evidence:* Each key ILO has at least one learning activity and one assessment task at the same cognitive level. The activities and assessments mirror the intended performances, with clear alignment between them.


**A3 Structure, Timing & Flow** — band 2 → 4.0/8

*Evidence:* The lesson plan has a coherent sequence of activities, but there are some minor issues with pacing and timing. Steps are present but uneven.


## B. Engagement & Interaction — 18 pts

**B1 ICAP Engagement Mix** — band 4 → 6.0/6

*Evidence:* The ICAP engagement mix is well-balanced, with ≥70% C+I and ≥30% Interactive. The plan also includes credible plans to realize this balance.


**B2 Generative Tasks & Prompts** — band 3 → 4.5/6

*Evidence:* The generative tasks and prompts are frequent and well-framed across episodes, but they could be more tightly aligned to outcomes.


**B3 Whole-class Participation & Interactivity** — band 4 → 8.0/8

*Evidence:* Whole-class participation and interactivity are high, with all-student response routines and structured group work. Roles and joint products are also clearly defined.


## C. Retrieval & Assessment for Learning — 10 pts

**C1 Retrieval Density & Effort** — band 2 → 3.0/6

*Evidence:* There are some retrieval opportunities, but they could be more frequent and of higher effort.


**C2 Formative Checks & Actionable Feedback** — band 3 → 5.2/7

*Evidence:* Formative checks and actionable feedback are present, with aligned exit tickets and mini-quizzes. However, the follow-up actions could be more explicitly stated.


**C3 Spacing, Delayed Checks & Cumulative Coverage** — band 1 → 1.8/7

*Evidence:* There is no clear spacing between retrievals, and delayed cumulative checks are not planned.


## D. Instructional Design & Scaffolding — 9 pts

**D1 Models/Worked Examples & Guided Practice** — band 2 → 3.0/6

*Evidence:* Worked examples and guided practice are present, but they could be more explicitly tied to the outcomes and with clearer timing.


**D2 Scaffolds & Fading (Generative)** — band 3 → 3.8/5

*Evidence:* Scaffolds and fading are planned, with explicit steps for reducing support. However, the fade-out could be more clearly timed.


**D3 Independent Practice & Monitoring** — band 2 → 2.0/4

*Evidence:* Independent practice mirrors models, but the monitoring plan is not explicitly stated.


## E. Cognitive Load & Adaptation — 7 pts

**E1 Intrinsic Load Sequencing** — band 3 → 2.2/3

*Evidence:* The progression from simple to complex is clear, with some segmentation of hard elements. However, goal-free early tasks are not present.


**E2 Extraneous Load Minimization & Modality** — band 3 → 3.8/5

*Evidence:* Integrated materials and concise on-screen text are used, with narration aligned with visuals. Brief processing pauses are also planned.


**E3 Expertise Adaptation & Load Monitoring** — band 1 → 1.0/4

*Evidence:* There is no clear early probe or differentiation for novices. Supports do not fade, and quick effort/load checks are not present.


## F. Inclusivity, Culture & Reflection — 7 pts

**F1 UDL & Accessibility** — band 4 → 5.0/5

*Evidence:* Multiple means of representation, action, and engagement are provided, with clear instructions and proactive accommodations.


**F2 Culture of Success & Reflection** — band 3 → 2.2/3

*Evidence:* Error-friendly norms and progress tracking are present. However, structured reflection linked to ILOs is not explicitly stated.

### Lesson Plan (excerpt)

Lesson plan: Artificial Intelligence Literacy Learning 

Note: This tool needs your expertise to be excellent. Double-check Khanmigo's accuracy and ensure wording is appropriate for any sensitive topics.

Learning objective

Students will define AI literacy, identify at least three distinct use cases of AI across industries, and critically analyze the ethical, social, and economic implications of these applications using real-world examples.

Student-facing objective: By the end of this lesson, I'll be able to explain what AI literacy means, give examples of how AI is used in different fields, and discuss the impact of these uses on society.

Standards: NY College and Career Readiness Standards (CCRS)

Learning activities

Warm-up

Display four brief statements about technology and intelligence:

"AI is the same as human intelligence."

"AI can learn from data."

"AI always makes unbiased decisions."

"AI is used in healthcare, finance, and education."

Ask students: "Which one doesn’t belong?" Have students discuss in pairs, then share rationales. Record responses. Guide students to notice misconceptions and accurate features, priming them to define AI literacy and explore real-wo…
