# Unified Lesson Plan Report (ULPR)

Total: **58 / 100**


## A. Outcomes & Alignment — 17 pts

**A1 SMARTIE Outcomes & Success Criteria** — band 3 → 6.0/8

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes SMARTIE outcomes (define AI literacy, identify various use cases of AI across different industries, and critically analyze the implications of these use cases in real-world contexts) with clear criteria.


**A2 Alignment: TLAs ↔ Outcomes ↔ Assessment** — band 3 → 6.8/9

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes alignment between learning objectives (define AI literacy, identify various use cases of AI across different industries, and critically analyze the implications of these use cases in real-world contexts) and assessment tasks (exit ticket + micro-quiz).


**A3 Structure, Timing & Flow** — band 2 → 4.0/8

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes a coherent sequence (hook, definitions & scope, group activity, short presentations, class discussion & debrief, wrap-up & assessment) but with minor issues in step design.


## B. Engagement & Interaction — 13 pts

**B1 ICAP Engagement Mix** — band 3 → 4.5/6

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes a mix of interactive and constructive modes (group activity, short presentations, class discussion & debrief), aiming for ≥50% C+I with some I.


**B2 Generative Tasks & Prompts** — band 3 → 4.5/6

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes generative tasks and prompts that require explain/justify/compare/predict (group activity, short presentations, class discussion & debrief).


**B3 Whole-class Participation & Interactivity** — band 2 → 4.0/8

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes some whole-class participation and interactivity (quick poll, group activity, short presentations), but with weak interdependence.


## C. Retrieval & Assessment for Learning — 10 pts

**C1 Retrieval Density & Effort** — band 2 → 3.0/6

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes one substantial retrieval or mix with low effort (exit ticket + micro-quiz).


**C2 Formative Checks & Actionable Feedback** — band 3 → 5.2/7

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes aligned exit tickets/mini-quizzes/oral checks with immediate use and task-focused feedback time.


**C3 Spacing, Delayed Checks & Cumulative Coverage** — band 1 → 1.8/7

*Evidence:* The lesson plan does not include in-lesson spacing between retrievals or planned delayed cumulative checks (≈2 days & 1 week).


## D. Instructional Design & Scaffolding — 6 pts

**D1 Models/Worked Examples & Guided Practice** — band 2 → 3.0/6

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes clear worked examples and specific guided tasks with timing, but no contrasting/common-error example.


**D2 Scaffolds & Fading (Generative)** — band 2 → 2.5/5

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes specific artifacts attached to tasks (AI Use-Case Canvas), but no explicit plan to fade supports and provoke self-explanation.


**D3 Independent Practice & Monitoring** — band 1 → 1.0/4

*Evidence:* The lesson plan does not include independent tasks that mirror models or a circulation/monitoring plan with error interception.


## E. Cognitive Load & Adaptation — 6 pts

**E1 Intrinsic Load Sequencing** — band 2 → 1.5/3

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes some segmentation and isolate then integrate, but major topics are still overloaded.


**E2 Extraneous Load Minimization & Modality** — band 3 → 3.8/5

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes integrated materials (no split-attention) with concise on-screen text and narration aligned with visuals.


**E3 Expertise Adaptation & Load Monitoring** — band 1 → 1.0/4

*Evidence:* The lesson plan does not include early probe, novices get more guidance, supports fade, or quick effort/load checks (e.g., 1–9) trigger specific adjustments.


## F. Inclusivity, Culture & Reflection — 5 pts

**F1 UDL & Accessibility** — band 3 → 3.8/5

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes multiple means of representation/action/engagement with clear instructions and proactive accommodations (captions/alt text/contrast).


**F2 Culture of Success & Reflection** — band 2 → 1.5/3

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes some tracking or brief reflection, but limited link to ILOs.

### Lesson Plan (excerpt)

Lesson Plan: Introduction to AI Literacy and Its Use Cases

Grade Level: Graduate Students
Duration: 90 minutes
Subject: Artificial Intelligence Literacy
Learning Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to define AI literacy, identify various use cases of AI across different industries, and critically analyze the implications of these use cases in real-world contexts.

Location: New York
Standards: Aligned with the NY College and Career Readiness Standards (CCRS)

Materials Needed:
	•	Slides with key definitions, examples, and prompts
	•	Case study handouts (healthcare, finance, education, public sector in NYC context)
	•	Internet-enabled devices (1 per student or pair)
	•	Whiteboard/markers or digital board
	•	Sticky notes or shared doc for brainstorming
	•	Timer
	•	Quick poll tool (e.g., Google Forms or in-class platform)

Lesson Flow:
	1.	Hook (5 min): Quick poll—“Where do you already encounter AI?” Show live word cloud.
	2.	Definitions & Scope (Lecture) (see below): AI vs. automation; AI literacy components; opportunities/risks.
	3.	Group Activity: Use-case canvas + ELSI analysis.
	4.	Short Presentations: Groups share findings.
	5.	Class Discussion & Debrief…
