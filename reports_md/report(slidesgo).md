# Unified Lesson Plan Report (ULPR)

Total: **52 / 100**


## A. Outcomes & Alignment — 17 pts

**A1 SMARTIE Outcomes & Success Criteria** — band 3 → 6.0/8

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes specific outcomes such as 'define AI literacy' and 'critically analyze the implications of AI technologies'. The objectives are also clearly stated, but there is no explicit mention of inclusivity or equity within the outcomes.


**A2 Alignment: TLAs ↔ Outcomes ↔ Assessment** — band 3 → 6.8/9

*Evidence:* The learning objectives align with the lesson structure and activities. For example, the 'AI Use Cases Exploration' section matches the second objective to identify and explain AI use cases across different industries. However, there is no explicit mention of how these activities will be assessed.


**A3 Structure, Timing & Flow** — band 2 → 4.0/8

*Evidence:* The lesson structure appears to follow a coherent sequence (activate prior knowledge → model → guided → independent), but the timings are not explicitly stated. The plan mentions '15 minutes' for the introduction, but there is no clear indication of how much time will be spent on each activity.


## B. Engagement & Interaction — 12 pts

**B1 ICAP Engagement Mix** — band 2 → 3.0/6

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes a mix of interactive and passive activities. The group discussion and presentation evaluation are examples of constructive/interactive modes, but the majority of the time is spent in passive/active mode.


**B2 Generative Tasks & Prompts** — band 3 → 4.5/6

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes some generative prompts such as 'analyze AI applications, benefits, and potential challenges' and 'prepare a 5-minute presentation on their findings'. However, the rubrics for these activities are not explicitly stated.


**B3 Whole-class Participation & Interactivity** — band 2 → 4.0/8

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes some whole-class participation such as group discussions and presentations. However, there is no explicit mention of how students will be encouraged to participate or how the teacher will monitor their engagement.


## C. Retrieval & Assessment for Learning — 10 pts

**C1 Retrieval Density & Effort** — band 2 → 3.0/6

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes some retrieval opportunities such as the group presentation evaluation and individual reflection assignment. However, there is no explicit mention of high-effort formats or distinct retrieval episodes.


**C2 Formative Checks & Actionable Feedback** — band 3 → 5.2/7

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes some formative checks such as the group presentation evaluation and individual reflection assignment. However, there is no explicit mention of how these results will be used to inform future instruction.


**C3 Spacing, Delayed Checks & Cumulative Coverage** — band 1 → 1.8/7

*Evidence:* There is no explicit mention of in-lesson spacing between retrievals or planned delayed cumulative checks.


## D. Instructional Design & Scaffolding — 6 pts

**D1 Models/Worked Examples & Guided Practice** — band 2 → 3.0/6

*Evidence:* The lesson plan mentions 'worked examples' and 'guided practice', but there is no clear indication of how these will be implemented or timed.


**D2 Scaffolds & Fading (Generative)** — band 2 → 2.5/5

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes some scaffolds such as group discussion worksheets, but there is no explicit mention of an explicit plan to fade supports and provoke self-explanation.


**D3 Independent Practice & Monitoring** — band 1 → 1.0/4

*Evidence:* There is no explicit mention of independent tasks that mirror models or a circulation/monitoring plan with error interception.


## E. Cognitive Load & Adaptation — 4 pts

**E1 Intrinsic Load Sequencing** — band 2 → 1.5/3

*Evidence:* The lesson plan mentions 'simple→complex progression', but there is no clear indication of how this will be implemented or if optional goal-free early tasks will be included.


**E2 Extraneous Load Minimization & Modality** — band 1 → 1.2/5

*Evidence:* There is no explicit mention of integrated materials, signaling, concise on-screen text, narration aligned with visuals, or brief processing pauses.


**E3 Expertise Adaptation & Load Monitoring** — band 1 → 1.0/4

*Evidence:* There is no explicit mention of early probes, novices getting more guidance, supports fading, or quick effort/load checks.


## F. Inclusivity, Culture & Reflection — 3 pts

**F1 UDL & Accessibility** — band 2 → 2.5/5

*Evidence:* The lesson plan includes some multiple means of representation/action/engagement such as group discussions and presentations. However, there is no explicit mention of proactive accommodations for students with disabilities.


**F2 Culture of Success & Reflection** — band 1 → 0.8/3

*Evidence:* There is no explicit mention of error-friendly norms, progress tracking, or structured reflection linked to ILOs.
