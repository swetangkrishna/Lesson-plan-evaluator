# Unified Lesson Plan Report (ULPR)

Total: **54 / 100**


## A. Outcomes & Alignment — 14 pts

**A1 SMARTIE Outcomes & Success Criteria** — band 3 → 6.0/8

*Evidence:* The objectives are clear and specific, using measurable verbs (e.g., 'Define AI literacy', 'Identify various use cases of AI'). The outcomes align with the standards.


**A2 Alignment: TLAs ↔ Outcomes ↔ Assessment** — band 2 → 4.5/9

*Evidence:* Some alignment is visible between activities and assessment tasks. However, not all key ILOs have at least one learning activity and one assessment task at the same cognitive level.


**A3 Structure, Timing & Flow** — band 2 → 4.0/8

*Evidence:* The lesson plan has a coherent sequence (activate prior knowledge → model → guided → independent), but some minor issues with timing and step design are present.


## B. Engagement & Interaction — 14 pts

**B1 ICAP Engagement Mix** — band 4 → 6.0/6

*Evidence:* The lesson plan aims for ≥70% C+I with ≥30% Interactive, which is a good balance of engagement modes. The activities promote active learning and interaction.


**B2 Generative Tasks & Prompts** — band 3 → 4.5/6

*Evidence:* Some targeted generative prompts are present in key episodes (e.g., task cards for analyzing AI use cases). However, not all tasks require explain/justify/compare/predict.


**B3 Whole-class Participation & Interactivity** — band 2 → 4.0/8

*Evidence:* Multiple all-student response moments are present, but groups have prompts with weak interdependence. Some structured group work is visible, but it could be more explicit and consistent.


## C. Retrieval & Assessment for Learning — 10 pts

**C1 Retrieval Density & Effort** — band 3 → 4.5/6

*Evidence:* Two retrievals with ≥50% high-effort formats are present (e.g., task cards for analyzing AI use cases). However, not all retrieval opportunities have high-effort formats.


**C2 Formative Checks & Actionable Feedback** — band 2 → 3.5/7

*Evidence:* Some aligned exit tickets/mini-quizzes/oral checks are present. However, the follow-up and feedback plan is unclear or missing in some cases.


**C3 Spacing, Delayed Checks & Cumulative Coverage** — band 1 → 1.8/7

*Evidence:* No clear spacing between retrievals; no planned delayed cumulative checks (≈2 days & 1 week).


## D. Instructional Design & Scaffolding — 6 pts

**D1 Models/Worked Examples & Guided Practice** — band 2 → 3.0/6

*Evidence:* Some worked examples or think-alouds are present, but they are not consistently used throughout the lesson. A timed, scaffolded 'we do' phase is partially visible.


**D2 Scaffolds & Fading (Generative)** — band 1 → 1.2/5

*Evidence:* Scaffolds like task cards and worksheets are mentioned, but their explicit plan to fade supports and provoke self-explanation is unclear or missing.


**D3 Independent Practice & Monitoring** — band 2 → 2.0/4

*Evidence:* Some independent tasks mirror models, but the circulation/monitoring plan with error interception is not consistently present throughout the lesson.


## E. Cognitive Load & Adaptation — 4 pts

**E1 Intrinsic Load Sequencing** — band 3 → 2.2/3

*Evidence:* A clear simple→complex progression is visible, and some segmentation of hard elements before integration is present. However, goal-free early tasks are not explicitly mentioned.


**E2 Extraneous Load Minimization & Modality** — band 1 → 1.2/5

*Evidence:* Some integrated materials (e.g., task cards) are present, but split-attention and redundant text are still visible in some cases.


**E3 Expertise Adaptation & Load Monitoring** — band 1 → 1.0/4

*Evidence:* No clear early probe or differentiation plan is present. Supports fade, but the quick effort/load checks (e.g., 1–9) trigger specific adjustments are not explicitly mentioned.


## F. Inclusivity, Culture & Reflection — 4 pts

**F1 UDL & Accessibility** — band 3 → 3.8/5

*Evidence:* Some multiple means of representation/action/engagement are visible (e.g., task cards, videos). However, clear instructions and proactive accommodations are not consistently present throughout the lesson.


**F2 Culture of Success & Reflection** — band 1 → 0.8/3

*Evidence:* No clear error-friendly norms or progress tracking is present. Reflection linked to ILOs informs next steps is partially visible but unclear in some cases.
